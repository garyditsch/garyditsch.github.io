When you are on a tight deadline, there are choices you have to make: Do I create something that will be future proof .. or .. Do I create something that will meet my current feature requests and user stories?

That is the decision I had to work through yesterday. I wanted to create a model structure that could accomodate all the possible uses of the race results data, which lead to random edge cases that I was trying to understand how to accomodate. In the end, I designed the models that allow me to meet the requirements I had set out in the planning I completed. 

This is one the values that using user stories, time boxes and having a deployment deadline provide - it forced me to evaluate the options and move forward. Another benefit of this methodology, is that it goes into the process saying, "We don't know everything that will happen in 6 months from now, but we do not need to. We can course correct in an upcoming sprint if necessary."

What I accomplished yesterday: 
* apps created race, checkin, results, accounts
* models created: Race, Result, Checkin 
* admin registered, so data can be added via Django Admin (used django registration redux)
* registration, login and logout set up : user can create new account and login
* did some css and layout fixes: added header and footer to the Django base template
