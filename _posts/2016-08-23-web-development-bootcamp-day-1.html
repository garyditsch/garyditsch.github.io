<p class="p1">The first day of bootcamp is complete and here are a few things that I took away with me:</p>
<p class="p1">1. Changing programming languages creates syntax issues for me right now. I anticipate this to become less of a challenge as I become more fluent in the languages.</p>
<p class="p1">I have been using python for some data analysis. I also build the Central Kentucky Grand Prix site on python / Django. This level of comfort seemed to disappear in the coding challenges. We could choose javascript or python to solve the problem. I started in python but switched to javascript. I have been studying javascript so much the past 10 days that I kept messing up the python syntax. I switched over to javascript and just dealt with the fact that I don’t fully know all the methods available, YET!</p>
<p class="p1">2. Git (and Github) is an amazing tool. However, learning how to optimize the workflow when working with a team of people on a project is going to take some time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve been using git for awhile on my Central Kentucky Grand Prix project. The big difference is that I’m the only person working on that project (well other than the person I hired to build an iOS app), so I do not need to worry too much about other programmers changing code. This will take time.</p>
<p class="p1">3. Working in teams is great! Almost all of my web development projects over the years have been done on my own. I’ve hired a contractor every once in awhile, but primarily done in isolation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Having a second pair of eyes on a task or problem clearly accelerates the time span it takes to get through a problem.</p>
<p class="p1">4. We had a lunch presentation on ‘learning to learn’.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Over the next 12 weeks, I’ll have the opportunity to test many of those ideas!</p>
<p class="p1">Main subjects and skills learned today: HTML, CSS, git, GitHub, 3<span class="s1"><sup>rd</sup></span> party tools to help build sites (google forms, youtube, paypal, google maps).</p>
