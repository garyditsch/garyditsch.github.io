When Bill Bruce came to talk to us last week about Agile Development and what his role of a scrum master is at Lexmark, one of the concepts he educated us on was story points. It's simply a way for teams to estimate the challenge a story presents the team, therefore allowing the team to predict their ability to complete the story within the next sprint. 

The ability to accurately predict the difficulty and story points depends on three general assessments: effort, complexity and uncertainty. 

In my project yesterday, I worked on adding Materializecss. I estimated that it would take an hour, at most. I based this on how easily I transferred a previous project from Bootstrap to Material Design Lite. However, I had no previous experience with the framework. That uncertainty ended up costing me some valuable time. I did not end up getting all of my Django models built, nor started on the api. 

Luckily, building both the models and the api are known work. I am hopeful that the complexity of the tasks does not become too difficult, so that I can get back on track. 

So, the question may be asked: was the extra time and effort worth it? I think it will be, as I really like the material design look and features available with Materialdesigncss.
