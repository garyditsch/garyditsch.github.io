          <strong>I am from</strong><br>.. Nebraska, however that doesn't mean I am from Lincoln or Omaha. I grew up further west in an area called the Sandhills. I now identify myself as a Kentuckian, having lived in Lexington longer than anywhere else. As many Kentuckians, I'm pretty proud of it. </p>
          <p>
          <strong>I am passionate about</strong><br>.. health, fitness and performance, which has guided my personal and professional decisions for the duration of my life. Which is approximately 38 years.</p>
          <p>
          <strong>I am obsessed with</strong><br>.. the intersection of my passion (see above) and technology. I am an optimist when it comes to the integration of technology into our lives, to make people healthier, more fit and perform better. Specifically, I'm interested how we collect and analyze data from new technologies that can be used by individuals to improve their <strong>health related behaviors</strong>.
